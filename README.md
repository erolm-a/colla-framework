## Setup

If you are using conda:

`conda install --yes --file requirements.txt`

If you are using pip (or the command above failed):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Foreword
`pyspark` does not seem to work with python 3.8 and higher at the moment. It is recommended to download python 3.7.* and then use `pip` to setup the project.
